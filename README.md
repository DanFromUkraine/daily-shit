# 📝 Ephemeral Notes

> A digital sheet of paper for your temporary thoughts.

**Ephemeral Notes** is a minimalist, single-page application designed to capture fleeting ideas. It features a nostalgic paper-styled interface with a handwriting font. The core philosophy is impermanence: all notes are automatically erased after a configured period (24 hours, 1 week, or 1 month), giving you a fresh start when you need it.
